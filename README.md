# Cannibal Open Touch Installer for Windows

Cannibal Open Touch Installer for Windows is an application that will be used to assist with recovery image installation, and other stuff. 

This application is under active development and will continue to be modified and improved over time. The current release is an "alpha" pending changes that will remove its dependency on hardcoded file paths. (see “Roadmap” section below).

## Goals

The Open Cannibal team plans to have the application ready and available at the same time that COT 2.2 is released. 

-- Ryan Norris, September 12, 2013

Releasing the source code for this application is meant to allow others to contribute code to help improve the platform.

## Requirements

* Windows Vista SP2 and up.

*Recommended:*

* Windows 7 SP1 or up. (Who uses Vista anyway? :P)

## Usage

There is an included help file in the application. All documentation will be there.

OpenCannibal Installer is a work in progress and currently exists at a very basic level of functionality. Priorities for future development are detailed below.

The following descriptions are for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as commitments or guarantees of future code releases in any way.


*Move from Visual Basic to C++*

The current release depends on Visual Basic.


*Install Profile*

The codebase is released as-is and currently supports a specific, standalone application. In the future we would like to provide an install profile that supports a wider range of applications.


*API Development*
